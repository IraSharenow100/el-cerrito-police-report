# PURPOSE: Create a new GitHub Pages blog post Markdown file with front matter,
#          body content, heatmap image, and link to the full report.
# HOW TO USE:
# 1) Update `repo_dir` below to the local path of your GitHub Pages repo:
#      irasharenow100.github.io
# 2) Run this whole script in RStudio.
# 3) Use the git commands shown after this code block to commit and push.

# --- USER SETUP: point to your local GitHub Pages repo directory -------------
repo_dir <- "D:/path/to/irasharenow100.github.io"  # <-- CHANGE THIS to your actual path

# --- Output filename ----------------------------------------------------------
post_filename <- "police-incident-analysis.md"
post_path <- file.path(repo_dir, post_filename)

# --- Construct Markdown with YAML front matter + content ----------------------
# Note: The date is set to today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
